# php-list-api

## Motivation

I wanted to have a clone of the GitHub API, in PHP (it can be used on simple host server which use PHP)

## Variable to change

- the link in `.htaccess`
- the path in `$GLOBALS['path']`

## Testing

Run a simple command

```sh
bash build.sh
```

Then go to `localhost:8080`
