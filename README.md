# php-list-api

## Motivation

I wanted to have a clone of the GitHub API, in PHP (it can be used on simple host server which use PHP)

## Two mode

Two folder for two mode :

- `rewrite_mode/` : if you **can** use to the `RewriteEngine` and the `RewriteRule`
- `no_rewrite_mode/` : if you **can't** use to the `RewriteEngine` and the `RewriteRule`

> Note that you need to have your PHP version higher than version `php56`
>
> You can use the file `.htaccess.temp` to force use the version 5.6 (if installed)

For the `no_rewrite_mode/` we use-bug php with the `ErrorDocument` directive, so you request will be in 404 BUT there will be data !

## Variable to change

- the link in `.htaccess`
- the path in `$GLOBALS['path']`

## Testing

Run a simple command

```sh
bash build.sh
```

Then go to `localhost:8080`

## Examples
